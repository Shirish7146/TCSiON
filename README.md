RIO-125: Automate sentiment analysis of textual comments and feedback
# Project Synopsis:
In the contemporary digital landscape, the influence of online movie reviews is undeniable. They wield significant sway over audience choices, marketing tactics, and filmmaker insights. Nonetheless, the manual scrutiny of copious review data proves arduous. Hence, this endeavor introduces an automated sentiment analysis solution tailored specifically for movie reviews.

This system will leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the emotional tone of textual reviews. By classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, it will provide insights into:

# Audience Perception:
 Understanding how audiences perceive a movie can inform future productions and promotional campaigns.

# Critical Reception: 
Analyzing reviews from critics can provide filmmakers with valuable feedback on their work.

# Genre Preferences: 
Understanding audience preferences for specific movie genres is a crucial aspect of leveraging sentiment analysis. By discerning the emotional responses associated with different genres, this automated system equips studios, filmmakers, and distributors with invaluable insights. These insights, rooted in audience sentiment, empower decision-makers to adopt a data-driven approach, thereby enhancing the relevance and resonance of their cinematic offerings.

# Data Preprocessing
Movie Review Data Collection: Movie review data will be gathered from trustworthy sources.

# Text Cleaning: 
During the text cleaning process, various steps are implemented to ensure the data's clarity and consistency. This includes the removal of punctuation and stop words, as well as converting the text to lowercase to standardize its format. Furthermore, techniques such as stemming or lemmatization may be employed to further enhance consistency by reducing words to their root forms. These measures collectively contribute to refining the text data, facilitating more accurate and effective sentiment analysis.

# Feature Engineering
Sentiment-indicating Features:
Relevant features will be extracted from the cleaned text to signify sentiment. Here are some examples:
Word n-grams: Sequences of words that capture sentiment patterns. For instance, a 3-gram like "worst movie ever" indicates negative sentiment.

Sentiment Lexicons: Pre-defined lists of positive and negative words commonly associated with movie reviews (e.g., "thrilling" vs. "disappointing").

Focus on LSTMs: 
Since LSTM models inherently possess the capability to comprehend intricate sentence structures and capture subtle nuances of sentiment, explicit part-of-speech (POS) tagging may not be deemed essential. LSTM networks excel at processing sequential data and have demonstrated proficiency in deciphering context-rich information, particularly in longer and more complex reviews. Their ability to implicitly learn syntactic and semantic patterns within textual data mitigates the necessity for additional linguistic features like POS tagging. However, it remains prudent to maintain an exploratory stance regarding the inclusion of POS tagging within the analysis framework. Should a comprehensive evaluation reveal discernible improvements in model performance attributed to the incorporation of POS information, its integration can be judiciously pursued. This adaptive approach ensures that the analysis framework remains dynamic, capable of accommodating refinements based on empirical evidence and emerging insights. Thus, while not initially imperative, the inclusion of POS tagging stands as a potential avenue for enhancing the LSTM model's efficacy in capturing sentiment nuances within IMDb movie reviews.

Model Training with LSTM
Labeled Dataset: A machine learning model will be trained on a dataset of movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

LSTM Model Selection: 
This report focuses on utilizing an LSTM network for sentiment analysis. LSTMs are particularly adept at handling sequential data like text, making them well-suited for this task.

Training Process:
The chosen LSTM model will be trained on the labeled dataset to establish the connection between extracted features and sentiment labels.

Sentiment Classification:
Once trained, the LSTM model can analyze new, unseen movie reviews. Based on the extracted features from the review text, the model will predict its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).



# sentiment anaylsis by using Textblob

This Python code performs sentiment analysis on a collection of tweets using the TextBlob library. Let's break down the key components and functionalities of the code:

1. Importing Libraries:  
        The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as TextBlob for sentiment analysis, CSV for reading input files, regular expressions (re) for text manipulation, numpy and matplotlib for data visualization.

2. Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - The code reads tweets from a CSV file ('newtwitter.csv') and preprocesses each tweet.
   - Preprocessing steps include removing non-ASCII characters, converting text to lowercase, removing URLs, fixing tweet lingo (e.g., converting 'cant' to 'can not'), and creating TextBlob objects for sentiment analysis.

3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - The code calculates the polarity and subjectivity scores for each tweet using TextBlob.
   - Tweets are categorized as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' based on their polarity scores. Polarity ranges from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive).

4. Evaluation:
   - The code prints out examples of top positive, negative, and neutral tweets along with their polarity scores.
   - It also generates a histogram of polarity scores to visualize the distribution of sentiment.
   - Additionally, it creates a pie chart to show the distribution of tweets across positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of sentiment in the given tweet dataset, offering insights into the sentiments expressed by users. It demonstrates how TextBlob can be utilized for sentiment analysis tasks in Python.



# Assumptions:
The project operates under the assumption that IMDb movie reviews are in English and labeled with sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). However, the model's accuracy may be influenced by sarcasm, slang, or informal language. Techniques will be explored to address these challenges, such as:

•	Adapting the model to handle sarcasm and informal language.
•	Incorporating sentiment analysis of slang terms.
•	Employing context-aware approaches to discern nuanced expressions. By acknowledging these factors, the project aims to enhance the model's robustness in accurately capturing sentiment across diverse linguistic nuances.



# Project Diagrams:
             The diagram shows how well a deep learning model is learning over time. It tracks a specific measure, like accuracy, as the model goes through multiple rounds of learning called epochs. On the graph, the horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the epochs, while the vertical axis (y-axis) shows the value of the measure (e.g., accuracy). The graph includes both training and validation measures, allowing us to see how the model performs on both the data it's trained on and data it hasn't seen before. This helps us understand how well the model is learning from the training data and how well it's able to make predictions on new data

1.Gradient descent optimization :
Gradient descent optimization is a fundamental technique in machine learning used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model. 

1. Common Optimization Algorithm: Gradient descent is widely used in training various machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models learn patterns from data and make predictions based on those patterns.

2. Adjusting Weights and Biases: Within an LSTM network (a type of recurrent neural network), there are parameters called weights and biases. These parameters control the behavior of the network and are adjusted during training to improve the model's performance. Gradient descent computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to these parameters, indicating how the loss would change if the parameters were adjusted slightly.

3.Minimizing Loss Function: The objective of gradient descent is to minimize a loss function. In the context of sentiment analysis, the loss function could be categorical crossentropy, which measures the difference between the predicted sentiment labels and the actual labels. By minimizing this loss function, the model learns to make more accurate predictions about sentiment.

4. Popular Variants: Gradient descent has several variants, each with its own way of updating the parameters during training. Two popular variants used for LSTM training are Adam and RMSprop. These variants are known for their efficiency in handling complex problems and have been found to work well in optimizing the parameters of LSTM networks.

2.Backpropagation is a fundamental :
Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm for training neural networks, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. 

1. Crucial for Training LSTMs: Backpropagation is essential for effectively training LSTM networks. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis where the order of words matters.

2. Propagation of Error Signal: During training, backpropagation calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter in the LSTM network. It then propagates this error signal backward through the network, layer by layer. This backward propagation allows the model to understand how each parameter contributes to the overall error, enabling it to make adjustments accordingly.

3. Adjusting Internal Parameters: As the error signal is propagated backward, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) based on the calculated gradients. By iteratively updating these parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss function, the model learns to make better predictions.

4. Refining Ability to Map Features to Labels: Backpropagation enables the LSTM model to gradually refine its ability to map features extracted from reviews to sentiment labels. By
 analyzing how errors flow through the network, the model learns which features are important for predicting sentiment and how to combine them effectively.

3. Activation Functions:
•	These functions introduce non-linearity into the LSTM model, enabling it to learn complex relationships between features and sentiment.
•	Commonly used activation functions in LSTMs include sigmoid (for output layer in sentiment classification) and tanh (for hidden layers within the LSTM).
•	The activation functions determine how strongly the weighted inputs activate the neurons within the LSTM layers, ultimately influencing the model's sentiment predictions.
Additional Algorithms (Optional):
•	Word Embedding Algorithms (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe): These algorithms convert words from movie reviews into numerical vectors, allowing LSTMs to process textual data effectively.
•	Regularization Algorithms (e.g., L1/L2 regularization): Techniques like these can help prevent overfitting by penalizing overly complex models during training, potentially improving the model's generalizability to unseen data.

•	Tokenization
•	Stop word removal
•	Sequence padding
Overfitting Mitigation: Given the complexity of LSTM architectures and the limited dataset size, we recognized the potential for overfitting during model training. To address this, we employed:
•	Regularization techniques such as dropout
•	Early stopping to prevent the model from memorizing the training data

Hyperparameter Tuning: We acknowledged the importance of hyperparameter tuning in optimizing the model's performance. Through systematic experimentation and validation on the validation set, we fine-tuned:
•	Learning rate
•	Batch size
•	LSTM layer configurations
By conscientiously addressing these exceptions, we ensured the robustness and reliability of our sentiment analysis model for IMDb movie reviews.

# Enhancement Scope:
